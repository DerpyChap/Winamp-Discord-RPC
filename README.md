# Winamp-Discord-RPC
Reports to Discord your now playing song as a Rich Presence status. Mostly made as a proof of concept.

To get this to run, you'll need to have this [Winamp](https://github.com/DerpyChap/PyWinamp) module and this [Discord RPC](https://github.com/DerpyChap/PyDiscordRPC) module in the same directory.

Yes, I know the code is terrible.
